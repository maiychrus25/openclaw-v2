# Playwright Pro

Production-grade Playwright testing toolkit for AI coding agents.

## Available Commands

When installed as a Claude Code plugin, these are available as `/pw:` commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/pw:init` | Set up Playwright — detects framework, generates config, CI, first test |
| `/pw:generate <spec>` | Generate tests from user story, URL, or component |
| `/pw:review` | Review tests for anti-patterns and coverage gaps |
| `/pw:fix <test>` | Diagnose and fix failing or flaky tests |
| `/pw:migrate` | Migrate from Cypress or Selenium to Playwright |
| `/pw:coverage` | Analyze what's tested vs. what's missing |
| `/pw:testrail` | Sync with TestRail — read cases, push results |
| `/pw:browserstack` | Run on BrowserStack, pull cross-browser reports |
| `/pw:report` | Generate test report in your preferred format |

## Quick Start Workflow

The recommended sequence for most projects:

```
1. /pw:init          → scaffolds config, CI pipeline, and a first smoke test
2. /pw:generate      → generates tests from your spec or URL
3. /pw:review        → validates quality and flags anti-patterns      ← always run after generate
4. /pw:fix <test>    → diagnoses and repairs any failing/flaky tests  ← run when CI turns red
```

**Validation checkpoints:**
- After `/pw:generate` — always run `/pw:review` before committing; it catches locator anti-patterns and missing assertions automatically.
- After `/pw:fix` — re-run the full suite locally (`npx playwright test`) to confirm the fix doesn't introduce regressions.
- After `/pw:migrate` — run `/pw:coverage` to confirm parity with the old suite before decommissioning Cypress/Selenium tests.

### Example: Generate → Review → Fix

```bash
# 1. Generate tests from a user story
/pw:generate "As a user I can log in with email and password"

# Generated: tests/auth/login.spec.ts
# → Playwright Pro creates the file using the auth template.

# 2. Review the generated tests
/pw:review tests/auth/login.spec.ts

# → Flags: one test used page.locator('input[type=password]') — suggests getByLabel('Password')
# → Fix applied automatically.

# 3. Run locally to confirm
yarn playwright test tests/auth/login.spec.ts --headed

# 4. If a test is flaky in CI, diagnose it
/pw:fix tests/auth/login.spec.ts
# → Identifies missing web-first assertion; replaces waitForTimeout(2000) with expect(locator).toBeVisible()
```

## Golden Rules

1. `getByRole()` over CSS/XPath — resilient to markup changes
2. Never `page.waitForTimeout()` — use web-first assertions
3. `expect(locator)` auto-retries; `expect(await locator.textContent())` does not
4. Isolate every test — no shared state between tests
5. `baseURL` in config — zero hardcoded URLs
6. Retries: `2` in CI, `0` locally
7. Traces: `'on-first-retry'` — rich debugging without slowdown
8. Fixtures over globals — `test.extend()` for shared state
9. One behavior per test — multiple related assertions are fine
10. Mock external services only — never mock your own app

## Locator Priority

```
1. getByRole()        — buttons, links, headings, form elements
2. getByLabel()       — form fields with labels
3. getByText()        — non-interactive text
4. getByPlaceholder() — inputs with placeholder
5. getByTestId()      — when no semantic option exists
6. page.locator()     — CSS/XPath as last resort
```

## What's Included

- **9 skills** with detailed step-by-step instructions
- **3 specialized agents**: test-architect, test-debugger, migration-planner
- **55 test templates**: auth, CRUD, checkout, search, forms, dashboard, settings, onboarding, notifications, API, accessibility
- **2 MCP servers** (TypeScript): TestRail and BrowserStack integrations
- **Smart hooks**: auto-validate test quality, auto-detect Playwright projects
- **6 reference docs**: golden rules, locators, assertions, fixtures, pitfalls, flaky tests
- **Migration guides**: Cypress and Selenium mapping tables

## Integration Setup

### TestRail (Optional)

export TESTRAIL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### BrowserStack (Optional)
```bash
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME="your-username"
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY="your-access-key"
```

## Persistent Agent Memory & Task Tracking

We use **bd (beads)** for all task tracking and persistent memory. **DO NOT use local `MEMORY.md` files or markdown TODO lists.**

### Task Tracking (Using `bd`)

1. **Find Work**: Run `bd ready` to see available tasks.
2. **Claim & Update**: Run `bd update <id> --claim` to claim a task.
3. **Complete Work**: Run `bd close <id>` when finished. 
4. **Push Automatically**: Work is never complete until you push! Ensure you follow the workflow:
   - `git pull --rebase`
   - `bd dolt push`
   - `git push`
   - `git status` (MUST show "up to date with origin")


### ��️ openspec `tasks.md` → bd Issues Workflow (MANDATORY)

Whenever a `tasks.md` is created or updated inside `openspec/` (or any spec folder), you **MUST** synchronize it with **bd** immediately:

```bash
# Step 1 — Create one issue per task
bd create "Task title here"      # note returned ID, e.g. ISS-1, ISS-2 …

# Step 2 — Declare execution order (what must be done BEFORE what)
bd dep add ISS-2 ISS-1   # ISS-2 is blocked until ISS-1 is closed

# Step 3 — Verify
bd ready   # authoritative queue: only shows tasks with all deps satisfied
```

**Rules:**
- Every task in `tasks.md` MUST map to exactly one `bd` issue — no orphaned tasks.
- Sequential relationships MUST be encoded as `bd dep add` — no undeclared ordering.
- `bd ready` is the single source of truth for what to work on next.

### Memory Guidelines (Using `bd remember`)

1. **Remember Important Context**: Use `bd remember <memory-text>` to store persistent knowledge (e.g., architectural decisions, user preferences, API contracts).
2. **Review Memory**: Run `bd prime` at the start of sessions to load the project's persistent memory and current state.
3. **Strict Domain Isolation**: When recording memory, specify the context clearly so other personas understand the domain constraints.
